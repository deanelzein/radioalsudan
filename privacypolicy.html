        <h2>Third Party Access</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process</li>

            <li>When they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request</li>

            <li>With their trusted service providers who work on their behalf, do not have an independent use of the information disclosed to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy statement</li>

        </ul>


        <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>

        <p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>

        <h2>Children</h2>

If the Service Provider discovers that a child under 13 has provided personal information, it will be immediately deleted from their servers. If you are a parent or guardian and are aware that your child has provided personal information, please contact the Service Provider at <a href="mailto:elzeinmd@gmail.com">elzeinmd@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <p>When connecting to our radio stream, your IP address will be sent to our radio service provider in order for us to track listening trends and provide licensing bodies with royalty reports. Once our service provider receives your IP it is immediately anonymised, deleted and becomes untraceable. This data is never sold on or passed to other companies.</p>


        <h2>For iOS Apps</h2>

        <p>Radioalsudan iOS App does not collect any user data when installed or launched on your device.</p>


        <h2>For Android Apps</h2>

        <p>The Radioalsudan Android App does not collect any user data during use.
